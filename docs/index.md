[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. yWriter's strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. With this Python script, you can combine the advantages of yWriter 7 with the advantages of OpenOffice/LibreOffice.


## Features (a Python 3 installation is required)

-   Generate a "standard manuscript" formatted ODM master document from an yWriter 7 project, plus an **ODF text document
    (ODT)** for each chapter.


With the [pywoo extension for OpenOffice](https://peter88213.github.io/pywoo) and the [yw-cnv extension for LibreOffice](https://peter88213.github.io/yw-cnv), you can write your edited Office documents back to the yWriter project.

    
## Requirements

- Windows.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work. However, Python 3.7 or above is highly recommended.
- [yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html).
- An [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installation.
