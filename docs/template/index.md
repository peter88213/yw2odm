[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. yWriter's strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. With this Python script, you can combine the advantages of yWriter 7 with the advantages of OpenOffice/LibreOffice.


## Features (a Python 3 installation is required)

-   Generate a "standard manuscript" formatted **ODM master document** from an yWriter 7 project, 
    plus **ODT sub documents** for each chapter.

 
## Requirements

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org).  
- An [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installation.


## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 0.99.0)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter88213/yw2odm/main/dist/yw2odm_v0.99.0.zip)

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile "yw2odm_v0.99.0.zip" into a new folder.
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the script for the local user.
- Create a shortcut on the desktop when asked.
- Open "README.md" for usage instructions.

### Note for Linux users

Please make sure that your Python3 installation has the *tkinter* module. On Ubuntu, for example, it is not available out of the box and must be installed via a separate package.
